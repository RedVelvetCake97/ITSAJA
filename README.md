 In today's world, time is precious no matter what we're doing. Whether it's buying something, enjoying leisure activities, or simply going about our daily routines, if a process becomes too lengthy or complicated, it often makes consumers hesitate. This hesitation extends even to online shopping.

Personally, I've bought items priced between ten to twenty thousand won and have spent weeks, sometimes over a month, checking and comparing across different websites to find the most popular products with plenty of reviews and see how long ago they were released.

From what I've observed among friends and acquaintances, it's not common for people to check and purchase items from just one website. Whether it's for interior design (using platforms like Naver, Today's House, Coupang, or Danawa) or IT-related products (such as Naver, Coupang, Danawa, and Daangn Market), many individuals search across various sites, compare prices, and then make their purchases.

If there were a service that could streamline and speed up this process of checking information on one site, finding similar details on others, and finally picking an item to buy, that would be incredibly helpful.
